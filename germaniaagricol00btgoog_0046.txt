ct velut eluctantium verborum-The partitive genitive is
used more extensivelythan in other writers, and its use
increases the force and perspicuity of the narrative; tho
same remark applies to the genitive joined with pro·
nouns. Annal. xii. 17, navium qimsdam circumvenere
barbari praefato cohortis ct plerisque centurionum inter·
fictis3 chop. 18, Romanarum nemo id auctoritatis aderat,

case which belongs to the verb), the word causa being
omitted—is used by no writer oftener than by Ta-
citus, in his strong desire of brevity‚ to express the
end which any one pursues: Annal. ii. 59, Aegyptum
pumicucitur cognoscendae antiquitatis3 iv. 2, neque sena-
toria ambitu abstinebat clientes suas lunaribus aut pra·
vinciis mandi. ·— Of the same kind are genitivos joined
with substantives: Hist, iii. 40, mendi tempora consul·
