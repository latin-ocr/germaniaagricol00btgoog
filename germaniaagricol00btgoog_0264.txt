forced to take refuge in Italy: he lived there, at Ravenna, for eighteen
years. Catualda was driven out by the Hermunduri, and also fied tu
Tiberius for protection. The followers of these two princes were
settled beyond the Danube, between the Morare and Gran, and Van·
nius, from the tribe of the Quadi, was appointed as their king (ΑΜ,
ii. 62, 63. xii. 29, 30. Ho'st. iii. 5). Pence was maintained between
the Romans and the tribes along the Danube till the reign of Domi·
tien, when hostilities broke out, and continued almost uninterruptedly
till the destruction of the Roman empire (Dio, lxvii. 7. Plia. Pan.
viii. 12). For an account of the great Marcomannic war, in the reign
1 ol M. Aurelius, seeDs'o, lxviii 9. lxxi. 3. 8-15. att-33. lxxii. 2.
After the death of Attila, in whose army they sarred, they are not
any more heard of. Ptolemy mentions as their cities, uem
(Budweis), odedm (either Marbach or Ispern), ’Aetnenses (Zlabings)‚
‘Pshseollas (Progne), Nolentem (either Niemes or Nimptsch), Καλάγ-
κοςον (either Zittaria or Collochau). ι
‹ Quande-The Romans first became aeqrrainted with the Quadi after
the conquest of Pannonia. They always appear in the closest connec-
-tion with the Marcomanni Their most ancient settlements on the
Danube reached eastward to the Teis, where they bordered on the
Getae; but partly in consequence of the irruption of the Jaryges,
partly through the influence of Maroboduus, they withdrew westwards.
1 Tm rame Quadi was giren to the mixed tribe composed of the fol·
lowers of Maroboduus and Catualda, settled by the Romans between
the Marus and the Cusus Towards tha north they reached to the
Carpathian Mountains, beyond which dwelt tlre Lygii. Their western
limita cannot be determined with accuracy. The original tribe of the
vQuadi seems to hare extended westwards beyond the Marsua, and tc
have united with their brethren en the east. They carried en wsrs
with M. Aurelius, Commodus, Caracalla, Gallienus, Aurelian, Constan-
tius, Julian, and Valentinian I, till the fifth century, when they ap
pear to hare coalesced with other natione (Dio, lxxi. u-la. 20.
lxxii. 2. lxxvii. 20). Their cities mentioned by Ptolemy are,
