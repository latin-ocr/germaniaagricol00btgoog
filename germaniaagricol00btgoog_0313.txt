Propinqua Inoe. —· At daybreak.

Secari pro alm, de panta certabant. - Ernesti end modern editors
have changed the reading in the text, which is that of the old editions
and the Vatioan MS. into Semtm de sdampro plania certabant. This
is urmecessary. Compare, Nunquam apud oos rerba feei, ant pro cobis
eamear, ant pro me macrior (Hm. iv. 58).

Cane. xxvia-enjus mmtantm ac foma-If this reading is

¹ ol the Rhine, is removed hy the fact, that many tribes in this part were,

eren at this time, dependent allies ol the Romans. This cohort was
most probably part of the forces stationed by Agricola in Candre, Car·
rien, and Galloway. From Dion (lxvi. 20) it appears that the course
ol this circumnavigation was from west to east. Στςασιῶσσιι γάρ τινες
