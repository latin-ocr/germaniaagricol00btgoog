though still analogous to thst of the Greek const, occurs in such
phrases as at ito dmm. In using opusfuit (c. 2), Tacitus probably
followed the practice obsersed in epistelary writing.

Rutilio et Scauro-Rutilius, in addition to a biography of himself,
oomposed a history and some orations He was lieutenant to Quintilius
Caec. Metellus Numidicus, suc. 645. He was accused oi bribery
by Scaurus, was unjustly condemned, and went into exile to Smyrna,
of which place he beccum a citizen, and refused to return at the invi-

M. Aemilius Scaurum was consul with M. esec Metellus in unc.

induced Scaurus to write a biography of himself.
