Namque perlodihiiam ..eoyebootua —- From the provinces, at least
during the times of the republic, and {rom Sicily, the Romans pro-
cured corn in three different ways ς by means of the srunwrdum deca-
monum, emptum, and certioratum. (See otc. Vm. Aa. ii. lib. iii. 6-
98.) Thesiamentnm minanam was the tenth part of the produce of
1¹10 ayer patrous or moranus. It was exacted from the cultivators
without payrnent (Asconius on oie. Verr. p. 29), and had to he car·
ried down to the sea (ott. Vera iii. 14); hut was generally pur-
