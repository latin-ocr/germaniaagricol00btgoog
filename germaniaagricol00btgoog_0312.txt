enin. xxvi. -rvonm mom ..aaaron-araia, following
Gordon ( It. Sept p. 32), places the scene of this occurrence in file,
where the remains ofa Roman camp are found at Lcchore ; and in
the neighbourhood isan extensive mcor, where large trunks cf trees
are frequently dug up, proving that formerly an extensive forest er·
isted there (quod nisi paludes et oloaefayreotea fatescat ᾰώείἰαίιιηι illo
marmio foret). We must not suppose, however, that all the remains
of Roman entranchments in this part are to be referred tc the time
cf Agricola ς many were built under the Antoninos and Severus
Moreover, Agricola's expedition in the sixth summer must have em·
braced at least Fife, Perth, and Augus, especially as his mcumicn in
the third year extended aa far as the Tay. The attach nponAgri·
ccla's entranchments towards the end of the summer, for it <annot be
placed earher, took place, as we may collect from the narrative, in
Agricola's rear3 and there is rio reason why we should not look for
these cntrenchments in Fife. It is well known how carehrl the Rc
mans were, in au expedition into an unknown and hostile country, to
secure the pasees and cover their operatione by forts ; and Agricolam
all probability would pursue the same course. The Britons would
naturally first seek to intercept the Romans ; and for the attach npcn
the fortifications, we annot fix upon a more fitting place thau Fiie.
Agricola had no sooner received the news cf this attach, and the advice
of his more timid friends to retire beyond the Bodotria, thanltheintelli-
gcnce reached him that the enemy were pressing forwards in lugu ,
bodies, probably on his flank and in the front, that, with the divisim ¹
which fell upon the forts in his rear, they might mmound his army: ,
which compelled him to divide his forces into three portioris. But
from this it appears tc follow that the ninth legion, which the enemy,
alteriug their plan, fell upon with their whole force, must have been j
posted further northwards than Fife, in Augus, or perhaps Mar. Tc
which we may add, that ingricola had been in the district of Fre,
which is hardly eight miles broad, he would probably have immedi-
ately scught the enemy at the entrenchmeuts.
