also found in the older writers, as iu Cicero, pro Lege

f. Tun lurrulrrvn is very frequently used by Taci-
tus for the sake of this same brevity and force. The
infinitive which is called historical is used oftener thau
by other writers (as Livy and Sallust; sce, On run

others), perpitque - addere reor equites Romanmum;
chap. 34, instabat-Narcissum aperire ambapee. A si·
milar use of the following words is adopted by the
poets: suadere, incumbere, mandare, orare, umere, am·
