Casa. XLVI.-Peacs'norum‚-'The Peucini, or Bastarnae, occupied
the country from the sources of the Vistula to the Carpathian moun·
taius, which, from them, were called the naama Alps, and dwelt on
the left bank of the Danube up to its mouth, in Transilvania, Galieia,
Hungary‚ Moldavia, Wallachia, and Bessarabia, They are classed
among the Sarmatiam by Ptolemy and Dio, amongst the Germano by
Pliny aud Strabo, who says that a part oi them were called Peucini,
on account of their living in the island of Peuce, off the mouth of the
Danube (vii. 2. 17). Others derive the name from Mount Peuce,
sitrmted above Dacia, near which, according to Ptolemy, they dwelt.
Livy (xl. 47. xliv. 26), Diodorus, and Polybius (xxvi. 9), who had
not leamt the distinction between the Celts and Germana, class them
amongst the former. They first appear in history ac. 179, seraing
under Perseus 3 then as allies of Mithridates 3 afterwards as members
of the Marcomannis leagne, and in connection with the Goths, with
whom they seem to hace coalesced, unless, as some ha've supposed,
they were the originators of the Frank league. Probus is reported to
