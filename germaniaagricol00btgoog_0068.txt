and punishment of the immortal gods, so that that mighty
imperial structure began to fall to ruin. Behold a se-
cond Scipio, not sitting among the ruins of proud Car·
thage when she had just fulfillell her destiny, but on the

soil of Rome herself, even now sinking to destruction,
and prophesying with gushing tears the ruin of his
countryl See him ,meditating not with a factitious
and far-fetched effort, but under aspects which to such
a mind present themselves spontaneously, upon the
image of his country, before so excellent and so perfect
in all its parts, now distorted and ruinedl And we see
that he practised no less art than Sophocles used in his
divine tragedies, in arranging every several part, and
assigning its own place to each. Aster prefixing, both
to the histories and to the books of annals, a prologue,
in which not only the argument of the whole work, but
its entire plan and character, are briefly shadowed forth,
he then leads the minds of his readers, now with aquick·
ened, and now with a slackened and restrained pace,
through all the stages of the action, which are meted
out in a manner fit and suitable to the things themselves
and to the laws of art; and he so depicts the natures and
characters of men, and of the actions performed by
them, he so pourtrays real life, even in its most varied
and troubled forma—whether he writes of battles and
the storming of cities, or whether of things done in the
palaces of princes, and the houses of private men,—
that all these things we seem to behold with our own
eyes, and to be present at them ourselves. But these
are matters of such a kind that their nature can be less
easily described than conceived in the mind itself. We
shall proceed to illustrate by examples those points alone
which belong to the poetical form of the language itself.
