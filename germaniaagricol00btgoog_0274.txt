NOTES ΟΝ THE AGRICOLA.

Cusas. L—Tbe composition of this work msy be fixed from internsl
end externnl evidence ιο the year of Rome 8504, four yemis after
Agricola's death The first three chapters comprise the preface, the
substance of which is this z—In times of yore, when there was no
reason, ss now, to dread men's ignorance of virtue, and their enry of
her rotarios, it was usual to hand down to posterity the exploits end
characters of forneus men 3 and a man was not found fault with cren
if he nannted his own life. Bnt in times like these, when we hore
only lately seen that to praise illustrious men was a capital crimul

must plead for favour and indulgence, which 1 should not bave done, ÷

hod not my poth lain through times inimicol ιο virtue, in which even
those romain unpunished through whose charges Agricola fell, und

through whose means many have been oalumniated At length, how· 3

ever, spirit and liberty are returning‚ though the desire of writiug
springs up but gradually and slowly‚ since talentu and seul may be
more quickly smothered and suppressed then ronsed again ιο vigunt
and activity ; and sloth‚ at first the object of our hutred, ends with
higratieting itself into our favour. Hence Ι sm led to hope that 1
shall meet with excuse for huv'mg formed the design of writing this

memoir.

of narratiom but as u present indefinite, expressing what is customary·
The corresponding use of the aorist in Greek is exceedingly common
It is frequently thus employed in similes ( Horu Od. χ. 299. Soph
Elect. 25)‚· and there are many instances of it in Latin. Cicero

(Dc Dic. i. 8), translating from Aratus, says :—Fuscoqoc nors nors ¹
