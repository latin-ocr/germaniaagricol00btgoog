sages, compared with those quoted above respecting the vexilla of the r

legions, sufficiently prove that there were vexillarii attached to each
legion ; and Tacitus (Anam. iii. 21) seems to show that they amounted
in number to five hundred : Vertillum veteranorum non ampliore qoinpenti

numero. But when there was any necessity they were detached from ,

their legions end sometimes those belonging to several legions seem

to have been united in one body. It appears that when they were l

engaged in the legions they were mixed up with the different cohorts

of these (Antonio, oeniiiwime eoiwrtibns et partem mudum ad inoc- l
