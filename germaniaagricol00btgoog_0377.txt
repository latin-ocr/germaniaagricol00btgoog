filled the office of consid, or those who had been praetem hut that by
the senate men oi consular rank were sent to the consular provinces,
and men of praetorian rank to the praetorian provinces. So that, as
far as the nature of the province is concerned, Marcellus might have
been called praetorem. But in xvi. 18, Tacitus speaks oi the pro-

anat oi Bithynia, and Pliny (idpnbb. malls. and elsewhere)
calls the governors of Bithynia proconsuls, never praetore or proprae-
tors. This is explained by Dio (liii 13), who tells us that Augustus
directed the govemors sent out hy the senate, whether of consular or
praetorian rank, to be called proconsules, but those sent out by himself
to be styled [epoti and prmoetcrea even though oi consular rank.
So that it would appear that, in this passage of Tacitus, either
the word praetorem has been substituted lor proowcabm by some
copyist, who found that Bithynia was a praetorian province, or else
that Marcellus is called praetor for some reason which is unknown.
Possibly he was appointed irregularly by the emperor instead oi by
the senate, and sent withan army to Bithynia Ernesti defends
proetmem on the ground that the word may'be applied to any gover-
nor of a province or commander of an army3 but Tacitus never uses
it in this general way. In ii. 56. 77. iv. 15. where yles praeterr and
ab praetoris occur, the lientenants of the emperor are referred to.
Tacitus carefully distingrnshes the proconsules sent bytho senate (i. 53.

= ii. 52. xiii. l. dcc.) from the propraetores sent by the emperor (iv. 73.

xii. 40. duc).

Moy'estotis poculum—By bringing a charge of extortion against
him. (see the end of the chapter.) Postulore is frequently used in
reference both to private and public trials. In the former, it properly
meare to ask the praetor's permission for bringing an action against
any one; in the latter, to ask his permission to impeach any one.
From this it same to be equivalent to coemere. In this sense it is
joined with the ablative in poscebat repetundis (iii. 38) ; but in other
passages with the genitive, like causare (vi. 19), arpzoere (vi. 10),
obmisere (iv. 13), demam (ii. 55).
