XX ΟΝ THE STYLE ΟΕ TACITUS.

things, which bore some degree of affinity to the things
which other writers had used those words to express.
Of this I will give the following examples :—

a. As in Cicero we read adducere habenas, in Seneca
adducere cultam ad tristitiam, in Quintilian adducta
fraus ‚· so in Tacitus, with a slight change in the mean·
ing of the word, Annal. xii. 7, adductum (i. c. severum,
rapidum) etquaei virile servitium ; xiv. 4, familiaritate
juvenili-et rursus adductae: and Tacitus alone appears
thus to have used the adverb, adductius (reparari, impe-

Then in the same sense as eepamre: examples of this

poets3 Annal. iv. 1, uuae originem, mares-expediam,

but exactly in the same way, diuae is used for ducere

Livy.

c. Erteruue, besides its common use, in which it
simply applies to foreign nations, as Annal. xi. 16, ire
euteruam ad imperium, is also in Tacitus synonymous
with dosidis; Hist. iv. 32, ut absisteret bella, ueee caterua
armisfaisie celaret ; iii. 5, rie iuter discerdiae (Romano-
rum) euterua molirentur. In the same manner diversus
is used by Tacitus of things relating to enemies and op-
