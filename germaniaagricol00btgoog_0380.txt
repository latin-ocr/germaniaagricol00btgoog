Achaiam ..dapmnum—The punition of the provinces between
the emperor and the senate was made by Augustus in his sixth consu-
late. He very wisely took upon himself the management oi the
frontier provinces. From many canses, the provinces under the direc-
tiou oi the senate were in a much worse condition than those under
the directior oi the emperor. As the main object oi the senators
was to share the spoil as equally as possible, the govemors sent out
by them were changed every year, and were appointed by lot ; those
sent out by the emperor were selected for their ability, nod retained
their command for several yeara—sometimeshaving more than one
province united under their jurisdiction. Agnnif a gevemer miscen-

, ducted himself, redress was more easily obtained hem the emperor

than from the senate, when they were linble to all the uncertaintiee
aud corruption ol atrial (see c. 2); and the legati oi the emperor,
having greater authority, were better able to repress disorder in their
troops or attendants. Tiberim, on several occasions, displayed his
contemtor the interests of the provinces (iv. 15) See Soet. Tib.

Vulgo. -The MS. has cahom. It is uncertain whether culpo or
io ochrae, is the proper alteration. meidolesum isvery commonly
used in this passive sense. See xi. 19. xiii. 53. Agr· 7. 39. Some
editors keep the reading υιιίφιι, and translate itas if ut were iutro
duced before formidolosam, · but this is *very forced. Others take
formidolosum ιιι the sense of simio, agreeing with vulgus But docte
tur will hardly allow us to suppose that vulgae rs the subject oi oryuieae. ,
