ΧΧΧ· ΟΝ THE STYLE OF TACITUS·

II. The force of the lunguege depends often on srnonn

wonns.
a. On anonnurfflvns, which are repeatedly used

by Tacitus (aud Sallust): some indeed he alone em·
ploys, as infensare, redemptore ,· in contemporary au·
thore also, and the writers of a later age, we find
appellitore, ndrnltore, auctitare, despertwe, suspectare
(i. e. suspectum habere), emptitore, mansitare, praeten-
tnre. But it must be well observed, that it is not always
theforce of the lenguage which depends on these words ;
but that they also often express an attempt, and that a
vain one (ns loqui coeptare), and in this wey also assint
the brevity of the style.

b. On single words put Assonnrnnrr Hist. iii. 55,
Lorium (i. e. jus Latii) enernr‘s dileryr'rr' ,· Annnl. ii. 32.
seno (Tarpeio) depectus est (compare iv. 29, robur et
sexum aut poricidornm poenes minitari).- Agr. 22,
nec-unquam per alios pecto avidus intercepit, that is,
through greediness of proise and glory. Hist. v. l, oe·
cupere princprem adhue omnum, that is, not yet engaged
by another, whose favour does not yet incline to any
one; so we have nnnlr'er earne, Annal. xiii. 44, eamus
adulter, xi. 12. -Hist i. 76, nc Aquitania quidem-
din mansit, thetis, continued faithful. Annal. ii. 33,
encesrr't Fronto (that is, went beyond, or digressed from,
the subject before tho senate), et postularit, &o (Com-
pare Quintil. iii. 9, 4, eyressio, vel, qnod neitetins eece
coepit, cernens.) Dinl. 21, videtnr milri inter Menenios
- studuisse, alter the manner of the Silver Age, iu
which studere is used absolutely for the study of the art
of rhetoric.
