c. The figure called in Greek ἓν διὰ δυοῖν, of which

we have an example in the well-known passage, pateris
libamus ct aare. But the examples of this figure which
are found in Tacitus (and they are very many) prove that
there is a greater power in substantivas and adjectivae
constructed aster this manner, than in the usual form of
speech: Agr. 16, neo allum in barbaris saevitiae penas
omisit iro et victoria (this has greater force than tra
victorae.- itis angerandthelicence of victory, rather than
of the conquerors); Germ. 33, super sexaginta milm-
obleetatt'oni multaque cetimum (not simply oblectationi
malorum, but for our entertainment and the mere plea-
sure of the spectacla). The copulative conjunctiora often
serves for an explanation: Annal. i. 40, incedebat mu·
liebre etmiacrabile waren (not maeatae mulierum ap-
men, but atroop consisting of women, and for that rea-
son chiefly miserable).

d. As to the examples of Posounsn, they proceeded
less from the genius of Tacitus than from the common
usage of the Latin language, nor do they detract in any
measure from the brevity of the discourse3 since none οἱ
the old writers has given offence by thus, as it were,
expressing things abundantly. But there are also many
among these passages of such a kind that the one word
adds somethingto the meaning of the other. Thus,
mare Oceanum is spoken of just as Rhenus amnia· empus
in all writers (contrary to the usage of our language) is
used pleonastically in such passages, corporis morbus,
