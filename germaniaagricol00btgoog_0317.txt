montepenoerio est (Dio. de Off. Proca. l.st.18.s6.§8.from
Ulpiano). The quibus metendis properly applies only to aroc ant
σκεταὶλα ; but the full expression would be, neque enim orco oet metallo
nohis amn, quihus commen, nepte portus qaorum redditur νεείνιηιιίἰε-
mmor.

Brtyaetes femina duoe- Camden substituted Trinobantes for Bri-
qantos, from Dion,lxii l. and Anool xiv. 31. In this he bns been
followed by several editors But the altemtion is unnecessary. The
insurrection of the Britons against Suetonius Paulinus began with the
Iceni and their queen, Boudioea. With the Iceni were united the
Trinobantes, et qui olii mem sewdiosroctc' resumere libertatem occultis
conjuroteonihns pept'ycront (donet xiv. 31). By these we cannot
well understand the Silures, in whose territory Suetonius was posted 3
and accordingly we must look to the northern tribes above the Iceni.
T he wide extent of the Brigantes, the loose connection of some of the
tribes with their queen, Cartismandua, and their fondness for warlike
adventure, which is marked hy their very name (Brigauds)‚ render it
not unlikely that some of the southern divisions of this mce took part
’ in the insurrectiones their neighbours. Why, moreovem should Cal-
gacus mention the remote and compamtively small tribe of the Trino-
bantes, rather than the neighbouring and poweriul oue of the Bri·
gantes? comprehenditis 32.

Et hiemem non in praesentio hinni —There is some corruption
in the text here, aud endless conjectures have been hazarded respect
ing it; but no one seems to have discovered the true reading. Τῖιθ
corrections moy be divided into two classes. l) Those which make
the words contain merely a repetition of the idea contained in intepri
ctindosniti5 aalihestntem onopraemciaillotum lihnon in proe-
sent adlatum lib. non in praesens vindtcoturi. Most of the inter
preters keep the words libertatem houm, aud explain loturi in the sense
’ oi carrying off ns a prize. Plus floyitii et pen'crcli loturos (Annei,
vi. 34). Οἶσὸμινοι δέξιν ( Thoe. ii. 12). The general meaning given
to the sentence is‚ “We who have not now for the first time to
wiri our liberty.'' 2) Those which make a sort of opposition be-
tween the two clauses Amongst these are, Et lit. nunc dmum pere
dicturi ( Gron.); et lib. omnem in procincte lauri —- et lid. in prae·
mium loturi(Esn.),· etlibestetem opraeepeem eleum loturi( Walch).
Compare Ne elatus felecitate mozonem rerum in non necessariam oleam
earo (niv. mvn eo. nnec).
