Ι. Among these examples, the conuocarlon or
ran wonns themselves first claime our attention. For
irruente passages in Tacitus, either whole or half verses
are found: Annal. i. 1, Urbem Rontom o principio
reyes habeam xv. 73, mee cocsevmr patrem deterritus
at, ce,· Germ. 18, ὂεῖίοναηι casua putet, epeia incipienti& ’
ehap. 32. praecelleat: nee mesor apud Cattos peditem
lues; ehap. 39, aegea-iia potrum et prisea formidine
mem. But Cicero has already ohserved that verses
osten fall also from the pens of writers through care·
lessness, of which there are examples in Livy and many
other authors: Livy moreover, as well as Tacitus, be-
gins the preface to his books of histories with an hexa-
metrical exordium, And indeed this clrcumstauce,
‘especisdly when two prinoipal writers agree in it, I can·
not believe to have fallen out at a venture; but, in the
ease of Tacitus especially, to whose language gravity
(σεμνόν) is said peculiarly to belong, Ι should suppose,
not indeed that he took pains to frome averse in the
very optset of his work, but that he retained one which
had spontaneously offered itself to his mind.
