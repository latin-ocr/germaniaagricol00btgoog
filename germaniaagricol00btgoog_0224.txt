Crine. XII.-These assemblies were convened chiefly to discnss

matters relating to war, and the offences tried before it were princi-
pally such as affected the military interests oi the nation. Other
crimes were placed under the ccgnizance of the princpes, who were
elected to administer justice amongst the different cantens and villages.

Dies-rimer capsih—By the word captat, in this and similar phrases,
is generally meent the entry ofa citizen's name in the census books ς
so that anything which affected a man's civil privileges came under
the title of capitis ds'scrimco. If a citizen were degraded to clower
rank, or had his name struck off the rolls‚ this was called a moneo
capitis. The word also occurs in phrases relating to capital pun-
ishments. Which of these meanings is referred to in this pss-
sage is not quite clear. The distinctions and relations between the
different classes in these German tribes were perhaps hardly defined
with sufficient accmacy to snit the former sense, and the latter sccords
better with the military character of the assembly.
