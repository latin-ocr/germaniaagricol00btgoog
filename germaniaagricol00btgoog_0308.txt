tus meant to say z-—“ In consequence of the vigomus, but at the same
time mild conduct ol Agricola, many tribes who had hitherto main·
tained a successful resistance against the Romans, laid aeide 'their

arms and became their allier, giving hostages for their fidelity; the “

weaker tribes, who had been hemmed in by Agricola, did not wait till
the Romans had commenoed active operatione against them, but vo·
luntarily came over to them.'' To accommodate the text to this in·
terpretation, he proposes to readz-Quibus rebus multae dudda,

maintains that we manifestly want the opposition between the two
members of the sentence to be marked in some way. Omitting the ct
before praesilire, or altering it to at, would leave some ambiguity; the
substitution of ccl, or orit, would produce a harshness The relative
aeae, he thinks, removes all these difficulties. The omission of the
verb substantive after the relative is common with Tacitus. See,
for instance, Quae tum nnana copia in arma, gui socii repes

pendent of the violent changes which Walch makes in etext, his
interpretation is open to this great objection,-that “ according to
his reading, quae praesidiis mendacemiam tothe w er states, andis
thus used in oppositiou to the states -guae ari Wcm dcem ar aeguo
egeram-it would be necessary that there should be some clause after
the second grac, which would inform us that the quae referred to the
wealrer states, since there is nothing in Walch's correction to warrant
us iu supplying this meaning. Many other corrections have been
proposed ; but none are satisfactory. Susius proposed that aiull stop
should be put afterpars,· and that the remaining words should be oon
nected with the following chapter, transterit being changed into tran
siit. Thus, Ut auiis aab Britanniae nora pars. Inlacessitc trans..
