Tot accredas dcc. — This refers to the war with the Daci, Marco
manni, aud Quadi, in the years tio—91, which ended with Domitian's
secund mock triumph 'ibe Dacians, since the foundation oi their
power under Boerebistes, had been involved in continual strugglcs
wita the nnana, n aee piscar, aaaron ina Moesia, lllyn'a,
and Thrace. About the time of Vespasiau, however, they were re
duced to a kind of dependence on the Romrms But through dread
of Domitiau's avariae, they dissolved their connection with them;
aud in a. u. 86 made an irruptiou iutc Moesia, where the governor,
Appius Sabinus who advauced to oppose them, was defeated and
alain. The struggle against his successor, Cornelius fuscus, who pe·

neuuted into Dacia, was longer aud more bloody‚ and frequently aar· =

n'ed cn with doubtful success. The last decisive battle, however, cost
Fuscus his life, aud the Dacicus plundered the Roman camp. The
fragmentary accounts which we have, ati'crd nc means of determiuing
accurately the chronology oi these events 3 it is uncertain whether it
was iu a. n. 88 cr 89 that Domitian went to Moesia, where he abau-
doucd himself to luxury and dissipaticu, whilst the experienced
Julian, through a successful battle near Tapae, penetrated almost to
Decebalus's capital, Zermigethusa; and although prevcuted from ad-
vaucing further through a stratagem of the enemy, he delivered the
Romans hom their critical situation. It could have been mere indif-
fereuce as to the event, or the desire of revenge‘, which iuduced Domi-
tiau to cugage in fresh struggles against the Marcomanni. He crossed
the Danube ; but received a signal overthrow iu their territories, which
compelled him to offer peace tc Decebalus.
