tlements on the hanks of the Po. Whether Gaul or Germany was
their original country is nnoertein: if the former, it would seem that
they aooompanied the first Gallie migration mentioned by Livy and
others, and followed Segovesus into Germauy‚ settliug ian0hemia3
but the facts thot, for the most part, the tide of migration set in
westwnrd, and that Bohemia has retained its name to this day, seem
to point to Germauyas their original home. From Bohemia they were
expelled by the Marcomanni, and settled in Noricum and Bovario,
where Boiodurum (Iunstsdt) took its name from them. At some
period or other, bnt when is aubertum, they orossed the Alps, and esta-
blished themselves in Italy between the Tarus, the Silarus, aud the
Apenninea They were snbdued by the Romans under Scipio Nesida,
aud afterwards removed to the hanks of the Drave. After this they
were almost subdued in wars with the Getae, and an extensive tract
in this part was called Deserto Boimm (Plio iii. 24). Some of the
Boii aooompanied Brennus in his invasion of Greeoe, aud joined that
part of his army which passed into Asia Minor, and settled in the
oountry called from them Galatia, where one of the three divisione
of the people hore the name Tolistoboii. Some of the Boii also joined
the Helvetii when they migrated into Gaul, and were allowed by
Caesar to settle amongst the Aedui. See Plio. iii. 20, 21. iv. 32.
Polyb. i. 17. ii. 20.

Bot'emum, or Boeberoana probably means, “ the home of the Boii ”

(heim, heimath). Some, however, suppose that, by Βοὼιιιιιιιι is meant
whatCaesar oalls oppidum Boiorum (B. (ι’. vii 9) inGallis, now
Beaujolois.
