lor the proper names The imperfect character of the geographical
knowledge which Tacitus possessed of Germany is manifest from this
work ul his upon the subject. Ptolemy has ventured to give a map
oi Germany, aad to lay down the latitudes and longitudes of a number
of tons and mouths of rivers. The greater part of these he never
udted himselfg and who, in that age, could have furnished him with
the requisite information? Indead, his map bears but a faint resem-
blance to the actual shape and features of Germany3 aad in the ma-
jority of instauees, it oen with difficulty be determined whether the
towns he mentioned existed at ah There is this additional disadvan-

nge in his book, that he detines positione by numbers, which, of all .

things, are the most liable to alteration through the mistakes of the
mscnbera One ol the most valuable geographioal monuments of
antiquity, Antoninus‘s Itinerary, compiled under the‘direction of J.
esar and Antony or Augustus, is availablc only fora few roads on
thefrontier. The Peutingerr'an Table is frequently ot* use in making
maps; unce, though the countries are excessively (listened, the dis·
unoes between the towns laid down on it arc given: but it is of
mroely any service in the case of Germany. Inscriptions and coins,
agaim which afford some of the best means ot* defining the situations of
places, are of rare occurrence in Germany. But in addition to all
these difficulties and disadvantsgea', the wandering aud unsettled cha·
uetes ol the Germana themselves rendere it totally impossible to lay
down a nup which should represent the relative positione os the tribes
³ at any one period, or for any length of time, though we can generally
determine the position which individual tribes occupied at some time
or other. This is scen from the wide discrepantias between Tacitus
aad his contemporaries, aud Ptolemy, and from such glimpscs as
history affords ns of the migrations of several of the tribes. (See
