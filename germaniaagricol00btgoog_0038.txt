xxvi ou rus srvis or uacuus.

vn. Iu rus rosrrlow os uanos, Tacitus in·
dulges in variety above other writers, following chiefly
the practice of his own age, and he even sometimes inverts
those phrases whioh other writers are want to preserve
constantly in a certain order, as, Annal- xi. 35, consulto
seruatus ,· (See above, III. e.)

a. Cognomens, or agnomens, are even ruscsu ss-
rons names 3 and in the same way, a term signifying the
dignity and offiee with whioh any one is endowed‚ is
expressed before the name itself, as Aprippa Postumus
and Postumus Apriupa, M. Auuueus Lusuuus and Lu·
cauus Auuaeus, Asinius Polus and Pollio Asinius (thus
Cicero also has Pollio Asiuius), Autouius Primus and
Primus Autouius ,· — dictator Caesar and Caesar dictator
(as in Cicero, reu Deiotarus, in Livy, reu Prusias ) ; im· ,
perator Aemustus, Auqustm imperatam but when this dig·
nity was perpetual, from the age of Julius Caesar down·
wards, the title of imperator (as before, in general, that
of dictator) used to be plaoed before the proper name.
Compare Suetonius, Caesar, 76, isumus uimios recepit
—praauomau imperatoris—So, besides the common
arrangement, praetor Antistius, procurator Marius, auffur
Leutulus (ss in Livy we have cousul Aemilius, consul
Sulpicius). Adduo these, tribunus plebis, and plebei,
and plebis (plebei) tribunus.

b. Together with the aommon order of the partiales
we find an aussrsorus of the prepositions and con-
junctions after the manner of the poetS, which is admit-
ted also‚ though less often, by other writers, chiefly of ἶ
the Silver Age: Amisiam et Lupiam amues rursu, ἵ
dissectas iuter et uia peruias assumserim iuter Vestalium:
-praeturam lurra stetit, uuum rursu damnum; aod ,
