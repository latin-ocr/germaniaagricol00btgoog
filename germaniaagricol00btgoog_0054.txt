β) Oitener and still more boldly thau other writers,
he uses the perfect passive participle in the place of an
abstract substantive, when it refers even to inanimato ob·
jects: Annal. i. 8, cum occisus dictator Caesar—pulment-
mumfaoinus viduatum Annal.vi.27, penus illi duonum, ’
uirida senectam ,· et non permissa prouincia dignationem
addiderat. Compare Livy xxvii. 37, liberatas religione
mentes turbauit rursus nuntiatum, Frminone infantem
natum esse quadrimo parem. ’

γ) Adjectives ending in ilio are expressed by perfect
passive participles; in the same way adjectives which
indicate a certain ease and perpetuity are expressed by
future active participles, and others also by future pissive
participles: Agr. 18, nihil arduum ant invictum eredere
(so Sallust) ; Annali. 28, noctem minacem et in ecelns'
erupturam fore ienioit,· iv. 38, pulcherrimae finies et
manaurae (lasting, enduring); Dial. 22, firmus eane
paries et duraturus ‚· Annal. ii. 38 (so Livy, the pects,
and the writers of the Silver Age), quamvis domus Hor-
tensii pudendam ad inopiam delaberetur (foedam, tur-
pem3 but it is easily perceived that the participle is
more forcible); Hist. iii. 84, pudenda latebra semet oc·
cultam.

δ) Ablatives which are called absolute are used in an
unusual way, and generally elliptically3 but examples
of the same thing are not wanting in the older writers.
The most uucommon case is that of the future active
participle employed in this way: Hist. ii. 32, inrupturis
tam infestis nationibus. Very often the participle of the
substantive verb (du) must be supplied as it were in
thought, when a substantive is found (put absolutely)
joined with an adjective or with a pronoun: Hist. iii.
