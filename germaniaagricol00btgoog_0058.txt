chap. 57, asor Arminii- aeqae aicta ia lacrimas (that
is, so as to shed tears), aeqac voce supplemata
ceteris aa' dicendam testimoniam exterritis, that is, so as
to utter their testimony. Compare Livy ii. 40, (Βοήθ-
lanas - consternatas ab aede aaa samsima* matri obviae
complexam and vii. 42, multitudinem aa' amaa coactar-
actam esse.

V. Nearly allied to these examples are the forms of
speech to which the Greek grammarians have applied the
terms συλλήψις and ζεύγμα, in which words that refer
to different kinds of things, or to different persons, are
joined together, and included in one and the same kind
of construction. Compare On rna Vemania, &a
V. b. near the end.

a. The term Siccensis I would apply chiefiyto those
passages in which things of an entirely different nature
are mentioned in connection with each other; as, dorrcc
ira ct dies permansit ,· qaia dissimulationem aaa etlasct'ot'a
caemaat3 abi aocte ac laetitia incaluisse oidct; mixti copiis
et laetitia ,· Germania a Sarmatis Dacisque matao meta
aar aroatibas separatam tribuat cam temore ct armaturam
catervis volitabant. In all these cases some affection of the
mind is so connected with things not pertaining to the
mind, that on account of this very difference between
the two notions‚ you would expect them to be differently
expressed, either by the use of words which properly
belong to each, or at least by some variation in the
construction of the sentence. To this head Iwonld
also refer those passages where the preposition ia joined
with an accusative includes at the same time the ablativa
or some other sense3 zGerm. 46, ia mediam relinquam
