xxxvi ou run suune or recusus.

Hist. iii. 58, nec deerat lpse rolin occe, lacrimis miseri·
cordiam elicere (but the common construction is, Annei.
xiv. 39, nec defecit Polyclitus quominus-incederet).
Tacitus alone appears thus to have used percellere, per-
pellere, aemulari, censere, nuntiare, denuntiare, saitem
(i. e. nuntio, scripto imperare), impetrare, inlicere, indn-
cere (i. e. permovere), componere, pcnyere, maerere
(Germ. 34, obstitit Oceanus (τῷ) in ce simol otqoe in
Herculem inquiri), inlacrimare (Annal. ii. 71, inlacri-
mabunt (τῷ) qnondomflcrentem-mnlielri fronde ce·
cidisse See Ou run Poumcun Courcaxmu, &c 111.
c. γ. Το the verbe deferre aud incusare, the infinitive
is joined in the place of a genitive or of the particle
qaod,· Annal. ii. 27, Libo Drusus defertur rnoliri res
nouom· iii 38, neque minna Rhoemetalcen-incusant
popularium injurios inultos necere (compare below, On
Genumana). On the other hand, qnod and nt are some·
times employed in a more unusual manner lor the accu-
Α sative with the infinitive: creditam quod-colried,-
qnilna jusserat ret-resisterent. See above, d near the
end.

g. The INDIcATIVE is often, even in the obliqua matio,
joined to the particle dnm, as Annal. ii. el, Piso aravit
nti traditis crncia moneret in cartello, dnm Caesar cni
Syriam permitteret mnaalilnr. Former writers have
seldorn spoken thus; and so in general the indicative is
found more frequently iu Tacitus thau in other historical
writers, when sentences are inserted in the obliqua notio
as if they proceeded from the mind of the writer himself,
as Hist. iv. 16, ae cnm cotnra, cni prienen-termulum
compressurum-No oue, moreover, has ‹ostener used
the indicative for the subjunctive, in that kind of sen·
