PREFACE.

Tnn following edition of the Germania, Agricola,
and First Book of the Annals of Tacitus, has been
’ undertakes with the view of supplying a deficiency which
has been experienoed by many toachers. The Germania v
and Agricola are the only parts of Tacitus which have
been hitherto published with explanations in English for
the nse of schools: and it has been justly considered
ἵ that the First Book of the Annals‚ on account of the in·
teresting and important information which it contains,
decernes to be more generally read than it is at present,
in the higher classes of our schools.

ln editing the following pages, my object has been to
present the reader with an accurate text, and to afford,
in the shape of notes, such information as is necessary to
y enable the diligent student to read the original with
’ profit. An explanation of difficult passages is usually
given; but I bave purposely abstained from giving
translations of those passages, which a little thought on
the part of the reader will easily enable him to under-
· stand. The notes are principally, but not entirely,
selected from the commentarios of Ruperti, Passow‚ and
