Marcomanni under Maroboduus, and were now, through the courage
and conduct of Arminius, the first people in Germany. ¹ The Cherus-

Tubantes, and Marsi. Tbese and other small trrbes are frequently
called Cherusci Thus the land between the sources of tbe Lippe and
the Weser, in all the accounts of the transactione before the defeat ot
Varus, is called the land of the Cherusci. But the power and influeres
which Arminius bed acquired roused the jeulousy of other princes,
end he was murdered by some of his own family. With him fell
the greatness oi the Cherusci. Internul dissensione ruined the whole
family of their ancient princes. In the reign of Claudius they sent to
Rome to ask, as king, Italicuaa descendant of the family of Arminius,
who was born at Rome. Being, however, looked upon as an alien,
be was driven out, but was reinsmted by the Langobardi (Annei. xi.
16, 17). Their league was speedily dissolved; feuds arose between
them and the neighbouring tribes, and a considerable portion of their
territory was wrested from them by the Langobardi, and they were
driven from the west of the Thuringer Wald by the Cutti. Ptolemy
