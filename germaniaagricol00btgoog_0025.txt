Of all writers Tacitus has taken most pains to vary

γ both single words and the composition of sentences.
i ln this quality he was preceded chiefly hy Livy and
Χ Sallust. And the care oi Livy in this respect indicates
copiousness and exuberence3 but that of Sallust an af-
fectation ol antiquity. The reason of this peculiarity

1 Tacitus himself plainly enough declares. For he says
2 that “his labour was in a restricted space and inglo-
n'ous ;’'-that “the positions of nations, the vicissitudo
’ of battleS, the triumphant deaths of generals, interest
and refresh the minds of readers; but he had to striny

rous friendships‚ the min of innocent men, and causes

‚ which had the same issue, things strikingly similar eaeo

laces amicitias, perniciem innocentium, et eosdem exito ⁴ causas conjun-
